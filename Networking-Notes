ðŸ“¡ Overview of Computer Networks â€“ Notes
a computer network is is a group of devices connetced to each other to share information 
there is more than 10 types of networks 
but the 2 main ones are LAN and WAN 
LAN is a network that is used in small areas like a home network 
WAN is a network that is used in bigger areas liek schools, businesses 

The purpose of thse are communication and resource sharing

Netwrks allow us to 
communicate between devices, 
share resources like files to other devices e.g printers
provides internet functionality for browsing and streaming
is the foundation for app conectivity and data transfer

in devops networks provide:
server interaction: enables communication between servers and applications
deployment: ccritical for launching and updating applications
manegement: important for monitoring and infrastructure maniging
optimisation: betters trouble shooting performance and scalability so data can flow efficiently 


LAN VS WAN
LAN:
connects devices within a small area such as a home or office and are used for small areas 
it allows you to communicate with different devices within a small area
for example when you send a fdile from your computer i your home to a printer this operates on lan 
and it also provides internet access in a small area

WAN:
WAN connects devices on a larger scale such as universities or buisnessis and are used for large areas
They connect multiple lans together to be able to out put a large range of network and is liek a high way for data

key network components 
switches, routers and firewall
a switch is a manager for a local network and connects multiple devices within a same network 
a switch maneges data flow and makes sure that data flows effectivley to devises and prevents any congestion

a router is a traffic guidence for a newtrok and its job is to direct traffic between different networks 
in your home a router connects the internet to your computer and ensures data gets to the right place 

a fire wall is a security guard for yournetwork and it monitors what goes in and out of network traficc and has control over that 
fire walls are vital to protect the netwrok from unauthorised access and monitoring / controlling network traffic

IP adddress and MAC  address
IP address (Internet protocal address) allows devices to lowcate and communicate with each other

There are 2 main types IPV4 AND IPV6

IPV4
They are the most comman and look like this
